One pleasent evening in the month of June,\\
As I was sleeping in my room,\\
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch,\\
And the song he sang was The Jug Of Punch.\\
\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
A small bird sang on an ivy bunch,\\
And the song he sang was the jug of punch.}\\
~\\
What more diveration can a man desire,\\
Than to sit him by an alehouse fire,\\
Upon his knee a pritty wench,\\
And on the table a jug of punch.\\
\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Upon his knee a pritty wench,\\
And on the table a jug of punch.}\\
~\\
Let the doctors come with all their art\\
They'll make no impression upon me heart\\
Even the cripple forgets his hunch\\
When he's snug outside of a jug of punch\\
\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Even the cripple forgets his hunch\\
When he's snug outside of a jug of punch.}\\
~\\
If I get drunk, well, me money's me own,\\
And them don't like me, they can leave me alone;\\
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow\\
And I'll be welcome wherever I go.\\
\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow\\
And I'll be welcome wherever I go.}\\
~\\
And when I'm dead and I'm in me grave\\
No costly tombstone will I crave.\\
Lay me down by me native peat,\\
With a jug of punch at me head and feet.\\
\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,\\
Lay me down by me native peat,\\
With a jug of punch at me head and feet.}\\
