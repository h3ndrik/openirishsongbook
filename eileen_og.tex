Friday at the fair of Ballintubber \\
Eileen met McGrath the cattle jobber\\
I'd like to set me mark upon the robber \\
For he stole away the Pride of Petravore\\
He never seemed to see the girl at all \\
Even when she ogled him underneath her shawl \\
Looking big and masterful when she was looking small\\
Most provoking for the Pride of Petravore \\
~\\
So it went as it was in the beginning \\
Eileen Og was bent upon the winning \\
Big McGrath contentedly was grinning\\
Being courted by the Pride of Petravore\\
Says he, \og I know a girl who'd knock you into fits \fg \\
At that Eileen nearly lost her wits \\
The upshot of the ruction was that now the robber sits \\
With his arm around the Pride of Petravore \\
~\\
Boys, O boys, with fate 'tis hard to grapple \\
Of my eye 'cause Eileen was the apple \\
And to see her walkin' to the chapel \\
Wid the hardest featured man in Petravore \\
Now me boys, this is all I have to say \\
When you do your courting make no display\\
If you want them to run after you just walk the other way \\
For they're mostly like the Pride of Petravore \\
