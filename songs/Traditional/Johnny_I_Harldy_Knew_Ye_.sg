While \[Mim]goin' the road to sweet Athy, \[Sol]Hurroo! Hurroo !
While \[Mim]goin' the road to sweet Athy, \[Sol]Hurroo! \[Si7]Hurroo !

A \[Mim]doleful \[Lam]damsel \[Sol]I heard \[Si7]cry,
\[Mim]Johnny I \[RÃ©]hardly \[Mim]knew ye !
\endverse

\beginchorus
With your drums and guns and drums and guns, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)
With your drums and guns and drums and guns,
The enemy nearly slew ye
Oh me darling dear, Ye look so queer
Johnny I hardly knew ye
\endchorus

\beginverse
Where are the eyes that look so mild, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)
Where are the eyes that look so mild
When my poor heart you so beguiled
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
\endverse

\beginverse
Where are the legs with which ye run, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)
Where are the legs with which ye run
When ye went for to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
\endverse

\beginverse
Ye haven't an arm, Ye haven't a leg, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
Ye'll have to be put in a bowl to beg
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm happy for to see ye home, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)
I'm happy for to see ye home
All from the island of Sulloon
So low in flesh, so high in bone
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
\endverse
