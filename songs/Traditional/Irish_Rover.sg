\beginsong{Irish Rover}[by=Traditional]

\beginverse
On the \[Sol]Fourth of July, \[Do]1806
We set \[Sol]sail from the sweet Cobh of \[Ré]Cork
We were \[Sol]sailing away with a \[Do]cargo of bricks
For the \[Sol]Grand City \[Ré]Hall in New \[Sol]York

'Twas a \[Sol]wonderful craft, She was \[Ré]rigged 'fore and aft'
And \[Sol]oh, how the wild wind \[Ré]drove her
She stood \[Sol]several blasts, She had \[Do]twenty seven masts
And they \[Sol]called her The \[Ré]Irish \[Sol]Rover
\endverse

\beginverse
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides'
We had four million barrels of bones

We had five million hogs, six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million barrels of old nanny goate tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover
\endverse

\beginverse
There was awl Mickey Coote who played hard on his flute
And the ladies lined up for a set
He would tootle with skill for each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet

With his smart witty talk, he was cock of the walk
As he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance when he took up his stance
That he sailed in The Irish Rover
\endverse

\beginverse
There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone

There was Slugger O'Toole, who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man, Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover
\endverse

\beginverse
For a sailor its' always a bother in life
It's so lonesome by night and by day
That he longs for the shore and a charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away

Oh, the noise and the rout swillin' poiteen and stout
For him soon the torment's over
Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
An old salt from the Irish Rover
\endverse

\beginverse
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
Just myself and the Captain's old dog

Then the ship struck a rock. Oh Lord! what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
I'm the last of The Irish Rover
\endverse
