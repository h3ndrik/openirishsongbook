One pleasent evening in the month of June,

As I was sleeping in my room,

A small bird sat on an ivy bunch,

And the song he sang was The Jug Of Punch.

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{A small bird sang on an ivy bunch,}

\textbf{And the song he sang was the jug of punch.}

\bigskip

What more diveration can a man desire,

Than to sit him by an alehouse fire,

Upon his knee a pritty wench,

And on the table a jug of punch.

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Upon his knee a pritty wench,}

\textbf{And on the table a jug of punch.}

\bigskip

Let the doctors come with all their art

They'll make no impression upon me heart

Even the cripple forgets his hunch

When he's snug outside of a jug of punch

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Even the cripple forgets his hunch}

\textbf{When he's snug outside of a jug of punch.}

\bigskip

If I get drunk, well, me money's me own,

And them don't like me, they can leave me alone;

I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow

And I'll be welcome wherever I go.

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow}

\textbf{And I'll be welcome wherever I go.}

\bigskip

And when I'm dead and I'm in me grave

No costly tombstone will I crave.

Lay me down by me native peat,

With a jug of punch at me head and feet.

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Too-ra loo-ra loo, too-ra loo-ra lay,}

\textbf{Lay me down by me native peat,}

\textbf{With a jug of punch at me head and feet.}
