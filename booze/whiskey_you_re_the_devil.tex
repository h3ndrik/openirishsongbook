Oh, \Ch{G}{whiskey} you're the devil, You're \Ch{C}{leading} me \Ch{G}{astray}

O'er hills and mountains and to \Ch{D}{Americae}

You're \Ch{G}{sweeter}, stronger, decenter, You're \Ch{C}{spunkier} than \Ch{G}{tea}

Oh, \Ch{G}{whiskey} you're me darling drunk or \Ch{D}{so}\Ch{G}{ber}

Now \Ch{G}{brave} boys, we're on the march

\Ch{D}{Off} to Portu\Ch{C}{gal} and Spain

\Ch{G}{Drums} a'beating, banners a'waving

\Ch{C}{Devil} a'home will \Ch{D}{come} tonight

Lo' fare thee well With me thitery doodelum the \Ch{D}{da}

Me \Ch{Am}{thitery} doodelum the \Ch{C}{da}

The French are fighting boldly

Men are dying hot and coldly

Give every man his flask of powder

His firelock on his shoulder

Lo' fare thee well With me thitery doodelum the da

Me thitery doodelum the da

Me right fol' tur-a laddie-o

There's whiskey in the jar

Says the mother : \og Do not wrong me

Don't take me daughter from me

For if you do I will torment you

And after death me ghost will haunt you \fg

We're off, fare thee well With me thitery doodelum the da

Me thitery doodelum the da

Me right fol' tur-a laddie-o

There's whiskey in the jar
