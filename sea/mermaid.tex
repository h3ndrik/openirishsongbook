\begin{SBVerse*}
Twas \Ch{G}{Friday} morn when \Ch{C}{we} set \Ch{G}{sail}

And \Ch{C}{we} were not \Ch{D7}{far} from the \Ch{G}{land}

When the captain, he spied a \Ch{C}{lovely} \Ch{G}{mermaid}

With a \Ch{C}comb and a \Ch{D7}{glass} in her \Ch{G}{hand}
\end{SBVerse*}

\bigskip

\begin{SBChorus}
O the ocean's waves will roll

And the stormy winds will \Ch{D7}{blow}

While \Ch{G}{we} poor sailors go \Ch{C}{skipping} to the \Ch{G}{top}

And the \Ch{C}{landlubbers} \Ch{D7}{lie} down \Ch{G}{below} (below, below)

And the \Ch{C}{landlubbers} \Ch{D7}{lie} down \Ch{G}{below}
\end{SBChorus}

\bigskip

And up spoke the captain of our gallant ship

And a well-spoken man was he

I have me a wife in Salem by the sea

And tonight she a widow will be

\bigskip

And up spoke the cookie of our gallant ship

And a red hot cookie was he

Saying I care much more for my pots and my pans

Than I do for the bottom of the sea

\bigskip

Then up spoke the cabinboy, of our gallant ship

And a nasty little lad was he.

I'm not quite sure I can spell \og mermaid \fg

But I'm going to the bottom of the sea.

\bigskip

Then three times around went our gallant ship

And three times around went she

Three times around went our gallant ship

And she sank to the bottom of the sea
