There's a Leprechaun in me head, and I wish that I were dead\\
For I don't think he'll e'er let me be.\\
Oh, he tempts me with his gold, and if I were e'er so bold,\\
I'd strangle him and leave him in the street.\\
~\\

\textbf{Well, he says to me, "Ah, you're no Irish Laddie!\\
And ye call that thing a harp?"\\
But each time I share the lore that I am learning.\\
He hides in shame while my friends they chant.\\
~\\ 
La ta tee, da diddley dee, la ta tee ta tee da\\
La ta tee, da diddley diddley dai\\
La ta tee, da diddley dee, la ta tee ta tee da\\
La ta tee, da diddley diddley dai\\}
~\\
There's a leprechaun in my room. He swats me with a broom.\\
That's the reason I forget the words of this song.\\
Well, he shows me a four-leaf clover, and before me song is over,\\
It's buried in a bowl of Lucky Charms.\\
~\\
Ther'es a leprechaun on the floor, and he says that I'm a bore.\\
He yawns aloud as I sing my song.\\
He feigns one last breathe stolen, but I see his eyes are open.\\
And he's watching me with envy deep inside.\\
~\\
There's a leprechaun on a hill, and his gold is buried there.\\
So I grab him by the neck 'fore he gets away.\\
The pot's too heavy, he giggles, so I pinch me just a little,\\
And he thinks he's fooled me as I run away.\\
