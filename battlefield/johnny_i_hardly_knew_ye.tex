\begin{SBVerse*}
While \Ch{Em}{goin'} the road to sweet Athy, \Ch{G}{Hurroo!} Hurroo !

While \Ch{Em}{goin'} the road to sweet Athy, \Ch{G}{Hurroo} ! \Ch{B7}{Hurroo} !

While \Ch{Em}{goin'} the road to \Ch{Am}{sweet} Athy,

A \Ch{G}{stick} in the hand and a \Ch{B7}{drop} in the eye

A \Ch{Em}{dole}ful \Ch{Am}{damsel} \Ch{G}{I} heard \Ch{B7}{cry},

\Ch{Em}{Johnny} I \Ch{D}{hardly} \Ch{Em}{knew} ye !

\begin{SBChorus}
With your drums and guns and drums and guns, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)

With your drums and guns and drums and guns,

The enemy nearly slew ye

Oh me darling dear, Ye look so queer

Johnny I hardly knew ye
\end{SBChorus}

\bigskip

Where are the eyes that look so mild, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)

Where are the eyes that look so mild

When my poor heart you so beguiled

Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child

Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.

\bigskip

Where are the legs with which ye run, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)

Where are the legs with which ye run

When ye went for to carry a gun

Indeed your dancing days are done

Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.

\bigskip

Ye haven't an arm, Ye haven't a leg, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)

Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg

Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg

Ye'll have to be put in a bowl to beg

Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.

\bigskip

I'm happy for to see ye home, Hurroo ! Hurroo ! (bis)

I'm happy for to see ye home

All from the island of Sulloon

So low in flesh, so high in bone

Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
