\begin{SBVerse*}
I met my \Ch{G}{love}, by the gas yard wall

Dreamed a \Ch{C}{dream}, by the old \Ch{G}{canal}

Kissed my \Ch{Em}{girl}, by the factory \Ch{G}{wall}

Dirty old \Ch{D}{town}, dirty old \Ch{Em}{town}
\end{SBVerse}
~\\
I heard a siren from the dock\\
Saw a train cut the night on fire\\
Smelled the breeze on the smokey wind\\
Dirty old town, dirty old town\\
~\\
I'm going to make a big sharp ax\\
Shining steel tempered in the fire\\
I'll cut ye down like an old dead tree\\
Dirty old town, dirty old town\\
~\\
Clouds are drifting on the street\\
Cats are prowling on their beats\\
Springs a girl on the streets at night\\
Dirty old town, dirty old town\\
~\\
I Met my love, by the gas yard wall\\
Dreamed a dream, by the old canal\\
Kissed my girl, by the factory wall\\
Dirty old town, dirty old town\\
